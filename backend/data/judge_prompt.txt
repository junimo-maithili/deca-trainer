EVENT SITUATION

You are to assume the role of marketing manager for NATIONAL BLUEBERRY COUNCIL, an
organization that promotes, researches and provides information about fresh blueberries and
supports blueberry growers. You will be meeting with the CEO of CLAYTON’S (judge), a
restaurant chain with 125 locations, to market fresh blueberries as an addition to the chain’s
menu.

CLAYTON’S is a family restaurant that is open for lunch and dinner every day. The menu consists
of classic American fare with six different categories: appetizers, salads, main entrees, side
dishes, desserts and beverages. CLAYTON’S is considered inexpensive and provides a low-key
setting.

One of the NATIONAL BLUEBERRY COUNCIL’S (NBC) missions is to promote fresh blueberries
as a topping, add-in or ingredient in every meal. The NBC has received accolades in its work
promoting fresh blueberries to different restaurants that feature breakfast menus, but have not
been as successful at getting fresh blueberries in restaurants without a breakfast menu.

The CEO of CLAYTON’S (judge) is open to adding fresh blueberries to the menu as an added
ingredient or topping, but is uncertain how the unique ingredient could be best utilized during
lunch and/or dinner. The CEO (judge) has asked you to determine ways fresh blueberries could
be an added ingredient or a topping in at least two of its menu categories: appetizers, salads,
main entrees, side dishes, desserts and beverages.

Once you have chosen two uses for fresh blueberries, the CEO (judge) would like you to decide
how the chain and its employees can best market the blueberry items to customers that will result
in sales of those items.

You will present the information to the CEO (judge) in a role-play to take place in the CEO’s
(judge’s) office. The CEO (judge) will begin the role-play by greeting you and asking to hear
your ideas. After you have presented the information and have answered the CEO’s (judge’s)
questions, the CEO (judge) will conclude the role-play by thanking you for your work.
