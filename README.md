Presentation Trainer is a website made to help you train for your DECA-style roleplays. Since it can be hard to always get feedback on your presentations, this website will do it for you!

It sends the transcript of your presentation to Gemini, which will rate your presentation so you can know what to improve on. Users can choose to submit a PDF of their case study for more personalized feedback. Whenever they are on one of these websites, a timer will start. However, when they get sidetracked and open another tab with something irrelevant, they will be urged to go do work.
